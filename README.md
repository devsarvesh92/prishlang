# 🍼 Prish: The Toddler-Inspired Programming Language

## 👶 Version 2.5.0 (Just like its namesake!)

Welcome to Prish, the world's first (and possibly only) programming language inspired by a 2.5-year-old boy who has already mastered the art of recursive function calls (aka "Why? Why? Why?").

## 🌟 Features

- **Tantrum-Driven Development (TDD)**: If your code doesn't work, just scream and throw things until it does!
- **Nap-Time Garbage Collection**: Memory leaks? No problem! Everything gets cleaned up during mandatory nap times.
- **Snack-Oriented Architecture**: All functions must return a snack, or they're not worth running.
- **Infinite Loop Protection**: All loops automatically break after 2.5 minutes, because that's the average toddler attention span.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pdm run prish
```

Then try:

```
prish> print "Dada, look what I made!"
Dada, look what I made!

prish> 2 + 2
4 (Wow, you're so smart!)
```

## 🧩 Example: The "Clean Up Your Toys" Function

```python
def clean_up_toys(toys_on_floor):
    if toys_on_floor > 0:
        print("But I don't wanna!")
        return clean_up_toys(toys_on_floor - 0.5)  # We know only half will actually get cleaned up
    return "Can I have ice cream now?"
```

## 🎓 Philosophy

Just as young Prish is learning and growing every day, so too is this language. We believe in:

- **Embracing Chaos**: Because if you can handle a toddler, you can handle any bug.
- **Learning Through Play**: If it's not fun, why are we even coding?
- **Unconditional Love**: Even when your code throws tantrums (exceptions), we still love it.

## 💖 Dedication

This language is dedicated to Prish, my 2.5-year-old son. May your curiosity never dim, may your laughter always echo in my heart, and may you always know that Dada loves you—even when you're reorganizing my perfectly sorted algorithm visualizations.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Grab your favorite sippy cup
2. Make sure you have PDM installed (Python Development for Munchkins)
3. Run `pdm install` (it's like setting up a new toy, but with less plastic)
4. Start coding with `pdm run prish`

## 🤔 FAQ

Q: Is this a real programming language?
A: As real as the monsters under the bed!

Q: Can I use this in production?
A: Only if your production environment includes dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets.

Q: How do I contribute?
A: Finger paintings and macaroni art are welcome in the `/artwork` directory.

## 📜 License

Licensed under the "Because I Said So" public license. (MIT works too, I guess.)

Remember: In the words of every toddler ever, "You're not the boss of me!" But also, please code responsibly.
